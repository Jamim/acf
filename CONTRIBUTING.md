# Suggesting a feature

We can't think of everything. If you've got a good idea for a feature, then please let us know! 

Feature suggestions are embraced, but will often be filed for a rainy day. If you require a feature urgently it's best to write it yourself :-)


# Submitting Changes

We use the usual GitHub pull-request flow, which may be familiar to you if you've contributed to other projects on GitHub.


# Licensing

When you submit code to our libraries, you implicitly and irrevocably agree to adopt the associated licenses. You should be able to find this in the file named `LICENSE`.

We typically use the MIT license; which permits Commercial Use, Modification, Distribution and Private use of our code, and therefore also your contributions. It also provides good compatibility with other licenses, and is intended to make re-use of our code as painless as possible for all parties.

* â€” our `CONTRIBUTING.md` is a compilation of such kind of files from other projects. If you've got any good ideas how to improve this document please feel free to do PR :-)
